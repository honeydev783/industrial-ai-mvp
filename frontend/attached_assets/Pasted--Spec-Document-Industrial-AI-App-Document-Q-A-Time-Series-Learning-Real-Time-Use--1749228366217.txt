üîß Spec Document: Industrial AI App ‚Äî Document Q&A + Time-Series Learning + Real-Time Use
________________________________________
OVERVIEW
This app helps industrial operators and engineers:
‚Ä¢	Ask natural language questions about their plant/process
‚Ä¢	Train the system using real events from SCADA or historian time-series data
‚Ä¢	Validate and use the system in production for anomaly detection, diagnostics, and optimization
________________________________________
‚úÖ PHASE 1: DOCUMENT Q&A (Knowledge Activation via RAG)
Purpose
Unlock value from existing domain knowledge before time-series data is used. SME knowledge becomes searchable and usable immediately.
How It Works
1.	Upload documents (PDF, Word, TXT, CSV)
2.	System chunks, embeds, and indexes content (RAG pipeline)
3.	User asks a natural language question
4.	System retrieves relevant content and generates an answer
5.	Sources are shown for trust and traceability
üìÑ Common Document Types
‚Ä¢	Control Narratives
‚Ä¢	SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)
‚Ä¢	Alarm Response Manuals
‚Ä¢	Cause & Effect Matrices
‚Ä¢	Tag Dictionaries (with Tag ID descriptions)
‚Ä¢	Operating Logs / Shift Reports
‚Ä¢	OEM Manuals
‚Ä¢	P&IDs (converted to text or structured data)
‚Ä¢	Standards (ISA-88, ISA-95, etc.)
‚Ä¢	Technical Guides / ‚ÄúBibles‚Äù

PHASE 2: TRAINING + VALIDATION (Build & Tune the Intelligence)
Access limited to SME Trainers only
Purpose
Create a reliable, explainable model that understands process behavior and failures using annotated time-series data.
________________________________________
üîπ 2a: Upload & Annotate Time-Series Data
Example Workflow
1.	Upload raw SCADA/historian data (CSV)
2.	System displays interactive time-series plots
3.	SME selects a time window (drag-to-select)
4.	Labels the event (e.g., "Pump Failure")
5.	Provides annotation: "Caused by upstream valve jam"
6.	System logs annotations with time range, tags, user, comments
Required Capabilities
‚Ä¢	Interactive multi-signal plotting
‚Ä¢	Tag filtering and selection
‚Ä¢	Drag-to-annotate interface
‚Ä¢	Save annotations with metadata
‚Ä¢	Access control for "Trainer" role only
________________________________________
üîπ 2b: Upload Pre-Annotated Files
Supported Format
‚Ä¢	Annotated CSVs:
Timestamp, PumpSpeed, ValveOpen, EventLabel, Cause, Comment
‚Ä¢	Or, CSV + sidecar JSON/YAML:
{
  "events": [
    {
      "start": "2024-05-14T14:40",
      "end": "2024-05-14T14:50",
      "label": "DripDetected",
      "cause": "Valve clog",
      "comment": "Due to upstream solid buildup"
    }
  ]
}
üí° Use Case
SME uploads historical failure logs aligned with SCADA data to train the system in recognizing event patterns.

üîß Model Training Types
Model	Description
Anomaly Detection	Learns normal patterns and flags outliers (e.g., Autoencoder, LSTM, Isolation Forests)
Root Cause Classifier	Maps signal patterns to known failure causes
Similarity Engine	Finds past incidents matching live or current patterns
Optimization Recommender	Suggests setpoints or ranges to improve uptime or efficiency
________________________________________
üîÅ Validation & Feedback Loop
SME reviews outputs from the trained model on held-out data or known cases:
‚Ä¢	Confirms or corrects detected anomalies
‚Ä¢	Updates or refines model via feedback
‚Ä¢	Helps fine-tune thresholds, classification logic
________________________________________
‚úÖ PHASE 3: USE IN OPERATIONS (Live AI Assistance)
Purpose
Put the trained + validated AI into real-world operation for alerts, insights, and optimizations.
________________________________________
üîπ Live Monitoring Mode
‚Ä¢	Continuous monitoring of incoming time-series data
‚Ä¢	Anomaly detection engine alerts on deviations
‚Ä¢	Recommendations engine suggests improvements
‚Ä¢	Operators receive context-rich alerts + relevant ‚ÄúLessons Learned‚Äù
________________________________________
‚öôÔ∏è System Behavior
Mode	Behavior
Live Monitoring	Model runs in real time, uses learned patterns to detect anomalies and recommend actions
Feedback Logging	Operators or SMEs can log responses, confirm/reject alerts
Auto-Retraining	New events and feedback feed into periodic retraining loops
